# Getting Started

*This guide assumes that you don't know very much about programming.  Some sort of technical background would be ideal, though.*

## System Explainer

Every month, cars need to be inspected.  Collecting the results and organizing them is something that takes a while, when done automatically.  However, since it's mostly the same stuff month after month that needs to be reported, this problem lends itself nicely to automatic systems.  The system that we've built handles recording data put in from missionaries as well as combining it with information about their area[^1].

The first thing you'll need to do is create a copy of the sheet we store everything in, which can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OXoJZ9xxGZOkut35Z47ZQKExe-LRvOZf_fGfthtlGjI/edit?resourcekey#gid=662692018)  This needs to be done with your mission's ``@missionary.org`` email account, otherwise we won't be able to access the data stored in there by IMOS.


First, go to ``File`` and click ``Make a Copy``:

![Sheets - Make a Copy](docs/Sheets-Make-Copy.png)

And then you'll get a dialog that looks like this:

![Sheets - Copy Dialog](docs/Sheets-Copy-Dialog.png)

We'd recommend moving it to its own folder (something like "Vehicle Coordinator" or "Car Checks" or something like that.).  You might be wondering why there's a warning that says something about Apps Script - well, that's where the magic happens!

Google automatically makes a copy of the linked Form when you make a copy of the Sheet it's attached to, but sometimes it doesn't quite make it into the right folder.  Because this is a Google thing, there isn't much you can do about that other than search for "Copy of PUBLIC RELEASE" in Drive and filter it down to the ``Form`` filetype.

![Google Being silly and not moving things to where they belong](docs/Finding%20Copy%20of%20Form.png)

Once you've found it, go ahead and move it to the same spot as your Sheet.  Again, we highly recommend putting this into a folder where it's less likely to get deleted on accident.


## Overview of the Sheet and Form

### Car Check Form

Here's what the form looks like for you, and for the people submitting:

| Editors | Viewers |
| :---: | :----: |
| ![Image of editing view](docs/Form-EditorMode.jpg) | ![Image of viewer mode](docs/Form-ViewerMode.jpg) |

You may notice that there aren't any area names yet.  That's fine, we'll get to that in a minute!

### Car Check Sheet

*We like to call these types of sheets something like ``Car Check Database`` or similar*

Here's what the landing page looks like:

![Sheets - Landing Page](docs/Sheets-Landing-Page.png)

Before we get any further into the sheet, we need to get area data in and working- for that, we need to go and run the contact importer.

### The Apps Script Environment

Okay, so you don't really need to know that much about this to get around and get this started, but here's a basic overview:

![Apps Script Environment Landing Page](docs/AppsScript-Environment-Start.png)

On the left side, you can see the file explorer, and navigate between code files[^2].  

## Making The Changes We Need

Before we get any further, copy the URL from your form and replace the demo version with yours:

![what to replace](docs/Form-Response-Link-Replacement.png)

This is how we tell the script which form to stick area names into.

Next, navigate to ``aaa-shortcuts`` in the Apps Script editor- we're going to get data into your sheet, and then update the area names in the Form's dropdown so that things show up.

![AAA-Shortcuts Page](docs/aaa-shortcuts.png)

At the top, you can see where we run code:

![Manual Execution Drop-Down](docs/First-Run-Authorization.png)

We need the following scopes for these reasons:

![authorization scopes](docs/First-Run-Auth-Scopes.png)

| Scope | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Google Drive | Part of accessing Google Sheets |
| Contacts | This is how we access the information stored about areas in your mission |
| Google Sheets | This is where we store data |
| Forms | Updates area names |
| Run when not present | Automatic updates to area names, form submissions |

If you click on the function name you can choose which function to execute.

First, we'll run ``run_importContacts`` so that we can get your area data loaded up.  (We also use this to get some vehicle information automatically.)

The first time you run anything, you'll get this lovely pop-up that asks for authorization.  You'll need to approve it in order to continue.

![Authorization pop-up](docs/appsscript-run-code-manually.png)

![Import Contacts Execution Log](docs/Import-Contacts-Execution-Log.png)

> *If you get errors, please ensure that you're running this as your mission office's missionary.org email account, and that [Google Contacts](https://contacts.google.com) has a label called ``IMOS Roster`` with contacts in it.  If you still have problems, please open an issue on [this repo](https://github.com/texas-mcallen-mission/carCheckSystem) and we'd love to help!*

Because doing work automatically is a bit of a pain, we've 

[^1] missionary names, zones and districts, and some vehicle information.

[^2] In the AppsScript environment, everything is treated like a global variable- there's no concept of import/export like there is in NodeJS.
